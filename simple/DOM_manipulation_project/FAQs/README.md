Project Overview

File Structure

        index.html: Contains the structure of the accordion and FAQ items.

        styles3.css: Provides styling for the accordion, including animations and responsiveness.

        script3.js: Implements the functionality of the accordion using JavaScript.

Features

        Accordion Interaction:

        Clicking on a question toggles the visibility of the associated answer.

        Only one section can remain open at a time; opening a new section closes the previously open one.

        Responsive Design:

        The layout adjusts for different screen sizes.

        Smooth Animations:

        Transition effects for opening and closing sections.
Code Explanation

HTML

        The HTML structure uses a container with multiple .content-container divs, each representing a question and answer pair. A heading introduces the FAQ section.

CSS

        The CSS defines the layout, background, and styles for the accordion. Key aspects include:

JavaScript

        The script toggles the active class on the clicked .content-container and removes it from others to ensure only one section is open.

How to Run

        Ensure the following files are in the same directory:

        index.html

        styles3.css

        script3.js

        third.jpg

        Open the index.html file in a web browser.

        Interact with the accordion by clicking on the questions to reveal their answers.

Customization

        Styling: Modify styles3.css to change colors, fonts, or animations.

        Questions and Answers: Edit the HTML file to add or remove FAQ items.

        Animation Duration: Adjust transition properties in the CSS to modify the speed of the accordion animations.

Browser Compatibility

        This project works on all modern browsers that support:

        CSS transitions

        JavaScript ES6 syntax
